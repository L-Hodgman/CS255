-Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The client for this project was DriverPass. DriverPass contacted us to build a system that both their customers and employees can utilize. The main goal was to construct a system that would aid DriverPass in efficiently and effectively teaching their students how to successfully pass their driving test by providing driving lessons, online classes, and practice tests.

-What did you do particularly well?
 I felt that I did a good job at creating most of the UML diagrams for the system. They were fun to make. I tried to make them easy to understand for every audience while properly using the correct diagram elements.
  
-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I am unconfident in my ability to create UML class diagrams. I'm not sure if I built this diagram correctly or not. To improve it, I would want to collaborate with someone or a team to go over what could be changed and revised. I'm not sure if I connected the correct classes and used proper variables

 -How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    First, I know the owner didn't want to focus his time on the system. For this reason, I thought that having the system run on a Cloud server was a better option for this client. Cloud servers automatically update as needed. Thus, the client doesn't worry about keeping the system up to date, and they can focus on their business. Also, I considered that their business will keep growing for years to come. Cloud servers are very flexible when it comes to scaling. If the system isn't flexible or scalable, it will become obsolete as more users join. Eventually, the system would not handle the compacity and would start lagging and crashing on the customers and secretaries. It's important to consider the user's needs because it is vital for building a product that will make our client happy. Making the client happy builds a lasting relationship with them. It's good for their business and ours.
  
-How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
   First, I looked at what the client wants from the system. What functions do they want the system to perform? How do they want to access the system? Holding interviews with the client is essential to figuring out how the system will be designed. Interviewing also opens up the possibility to brainstorm and collaborate with the client. Designing models for the system is also essential. It helps the development team in showing how the system will be built and run. Models also aid in finding any errors and redundancies before development starts.
